You can get the full grade when you are close to what is the expected maximal performance. You don't need to invest lots of effort into the last tiny improvement, though. Unless specified, we look at the accuracy on the validation set. If your learning curves are very erratic we'll compute a score based on the smoothed curves (i.e. single peaks don't count).\n",

A block was added (adding more reduces resolution to below 4x4). All number of layers were tried with a maximum of 4 per block (preserve resolution). Dropout layers with increasing rates were added (reduce dimensionality, increase translational invariance). The number of filters were doubled after each block (learning complex patterns). BatchNormalization was added (stabilize learning). A Learnable Conv2D with stride 2 replaced MaxPooling2D. Finally, starting dropout rates and filters, and hidden units of Dense layer were tuned using hypermodel RandomSearch. Also tuned optimizers and learning rates manually.\"\"\"\n",
